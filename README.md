Don't make me name things. Trying to extend the TinyRaycaster thing to an actual game

## ToDo 
* Essentially get back to the same point
- [ ] read in a map and display it (as an image thingy)
- [ ] drawRect api :), aka drawFilledQuad
- [ ] draw Player
- [ ] display fov
- [ ] basic 3D
- [ ] rotate it :)
- [ ] add textures
- [ ] add enemies
- [ ] create movement
- [ ] create a gun
- [ ] have enemies move towards you
- [ ] create some sort of map editor for it
